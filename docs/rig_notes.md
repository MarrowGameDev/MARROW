# Marrow — Modular Rig / Procedural Animation notes

Isolated prototype for the "Modular Rigging and Procedural Animation" brief.
**Not wired into the real player yet** (brief Phase G) — test it in `rig_test.tscn` first.

## How to test
Open `scenes/rig_test.tscn` in Godot and run it (F6 / "Run Current Scene").

- **WASD** — move. Body bobs, torso leans, arms/legs swing, and the whole figure
  turns smoothly toward the movement direction. Standing still = subtle idle breathing.
- **Space** — attack: a quick forward arm thrust + torso twist that blends back out
  (Phase E), readable while idle or walking.
- **Q** — cycles equipping **Arm → Leg → Heavy** into their slots. The grey limb is
  swapped for a bone-colored one; Heavy is bigger (visual_scale) and heavier.
- Walk **forward onto the ramp** (in front of spawn) to see foot placement (Phase F):
  each foot raycasts down and plants on the surface, tilting to the slope.

## Architecture (animate sockets, not meshes)
- `scripts/rig/modular_skeleton_rig.gd` (`ModularSkeletonRig`) — builds Node3D
  sockets in `_ready()` and hangs a grey box on each. `equip_bone(id, def)` /
  `unequip_slot(slot)` swap the socket's visual. Equipped bones are children of
  sockets, so they inherit socket motion for free.
- `scripts/rig/procedural_player_animator.gd` (`ProceduralPlayerAnimator`) —
  `update_from_player(delta, velocity, max_speed, facing, equipped_defs)` moves
  the sockets from the ACTUAL velocity (so slopes/knockback/speed bonuses all read
  correctly). Layers: idle breathing, walk bob, torso lean/sway, arm+leg swing,
  turn smoothing, weight response.
- `scripts/bone_database.gd` — compatibility layer for bone data; `weight`
  remains the legacy animation weight while `physical_weight`,
  `equipment_weight`, `inventory_weight` and `weight_class` are available for
  future rig/inventory rules.
- `scripts/rig/rig_test_player.gd` — sandbox movement controller (no combat/inventory).

## Tuning variables (exports on ProceduralAnimator)
walk_cycle_speed 8.0 · body_bob_amount 0.08 · body_sway_amount 0.04 ·
torso_lean_amount 0.12 · arm_swing_amount 0.45 · leg_swing_amount 0.35 ·
turn_smoothing 12.0 · idle_breath_amount 0.025 · heavy_weight_swing_slowdown 0.65

## Phase E/F tuning (exports on ProceduralAnimator)
attack_overlay_duration 0.16 · attack_overlay_blend_speed 18 · attack_arm_forward 1.1 ·
attack_torso_twist 0.35 · foot_raycast_up/down 0.6/1.4 · foot_lift 0.06 ·
foot_smoothing 14 · foot_align_to_normal true (uncheck foot_placement_enabled to disable).

## Known limitations / TODO
- Socket positions & limb sizes are hand-estimated grey-box values — expect to
  nudge them once seen in a real window.
- Body facing yaw uses `atan2(facing.x, facing.z)`; if the figure faces backwards,
  flip the sign (orientation not verified visually).
- Attack overlay sign (arm forward/back) not visually verified — flip
  `attack_arm_forward` if it thrusts the wrong way.
- Feet are independent of the swinging leg boxes (no knee IK yet, per the brief's
  grey-box rule); on steep slopes there may be a visible leg/foot gap.
- Foot placement done on flat ground + a ramp; steps not added (CharacterBody3D
  needs step-up logic to climb vertical steps).
- Not merged into the real player (Phase G) — do that only after this feels good.
